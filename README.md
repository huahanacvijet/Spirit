|Huā's initial design had them in a light blue hanfu! 🩵  Their current red hanfu, whilst ultimately being the colour I would have gone for anyway, was not something I actually made the final choice for. 🤔  It was purely a case where, when trialing if I even have the capability to do pixel-art and animation alone, I began to make the first animation (which was the flute playing one 🪈🎶) when their hanfu was still red. The animation turned out so well that I didn't want to risk ruining it by having to frame-by-frame change the hanfu colour! 🥲 The website I used to draw Huā did not have a sync feature for multiple frames, so I simply stuck to the red! ❤️ | <img height="200" src="./resources-readme/Hua-Blue-Design.png"  /> <img height="200" src="./resources-readme/Hua-Red-Design.png"  /> |
| I basically winged the animations for Huā, but when it came to the background, I was finally forced to actually make a sketch plan of where each component of it should go in the drawing. So, in some early prototypes, the background of Spirit looked like this: | <img src="./resources-readme/Background-Sketch.png" width="400"> |
|When making the design prototype for Spirit, I trialed various colour schemes, with pink being the outside border in one. I also trialed various approaches to the to do list idea, for example, a starting menu, a starting page with just an add button in the centre, and a little logo animation before the app loads.|<img align="right" height="800" src="./resources-readme/Figma-Design-Prototype.png"  />|
