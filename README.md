### BTS Log:
Huā's initial design had them in a light blue hanfu! 🩵  
Their current red hanfu, whilst ultimately being the colour I would have gone for anyway, was not something I actually made the final choice for. 🤔  
It was purely a case where, when trialing if I even have the capability to do pixel-art and animation alone, I began to make the first animation (which was the flute playing one 🪈🎶) when their hanfu was still red. The animation turned out so well that I didn't want to risk ruining it by having to frame-by-frame change the hanfu colour! 🥲 The website I used to draw Huā did not have a sync feature for multiple frames, so I simply stuck to the red! ❤️
